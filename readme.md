# The Nonagons
## Introduction
The Nonagons are an art project I started back in December of 2019 to fill the space on an empty wall in my living room. I had some LEDs and an old raspberry pi laying around that were put to good use in the nonagons.
## Parts
- Raspberry Pi 2b+
- 4 144 LED/m Dotstar Strips (only 434 LEDs total used and I bought mine from adafruit but you can find them cheaper as APA102 led strips)
- Mini USB Microphone
- Female DC Power adapter - 2.1mm jack to screw terminal block
- 74AHCT125 - Quad Level-Shifter (3V to 5V)
- 10a / 5V power supply
- 40 4pin strip-to-strip LED connectors 10mm wide (these were actually not wide enough but ended up working)
- A large assortment of jumpper wires of all types
- 4700uF 10v Capacitor
- 2 feet x 2 feet x 1/4 inch project board (https://www.homedepot.com/p/Columbia-Forest-Products-3-4-in-x-2-ft-x-2-ft-PureBond-Walnut-Plywood-Project-Panel-Free-Custom-Cut-Available-2731/204771202)
- A test board with the same dimensions as above made of something cheap like MDF
- Excess wood, preferably also 1/4in thick (used for gluing to the main project board, screwing the screw eyes into and hanging from)
- 2 Screw Eyes
- Picture Hanging Wire
- Wood Stain
- Spray on Lacquer
- Gorilla Glue
- Slightly more than 8ft of Aluminum that is 2 inches wide (one of these and maybe another that is at least 4 ft https://www.lowes.com/pd/Steelworks-0-125-ft-x-2-in-Aluminum-Solid/3058163)

## Tools
- An exacto knife preferably with a couple different attachments for different jobs
- A CNC Router (I used an x-carve with a 1/8th inch drill  bit for the whole project)
- A 3D Printer with clear filament
- Clamps
- A hacksaw with a blade for cutting metal
- Soldering Iron & Solder
- Gloves
- A Tarp 
- Something to spread wood stain with
- A respirator if you use spray on lacquer
- Sandpaper of varyings grits (Some for wood, some very fine for the aluminum pieces)

## 3D Printing
The plastic nonagons were first designed in Blender as a flat surface with walls to keep the LEDs inside. Then I printed them with transparent filament.

At this point there was no plan for the board and after seeing that they managed to fit some LEDs comfortably inside, then the rest of the board was planned around their size
